## 1. High-level overview

There are **two main codebases** involved:

1. **Frontend SPA (Quasar / Vue)**
   - GitHub: `https://github.com/SaleamEssop/MyCities-Vue-Quasar`
   - Built as a SPA and deployed under `/web-app/` on the Laravel server & staging host.

2. **Backend + Admin (Laravel)**
   - GitHub: `https://github.com/SaleamEssop/MyCities-Server-Admin---Laravel`
   - Lives at: `/var/www/mycities.co.za`
   - Contains Laravel app, API, and the `web-app` folder used to serve the SPA.

The current production **user-facing UI** is the “green MyCities” design (screenshot you provided from mobile).  
However, the **Quasar repo on GitHub currently corresponds to an older / legacy UI**.

This mismatch is the core reason we hit issues when rebuilding from Git.

## 2. Repositories and their roles

### 2.1 Quasar frontend repo

- **Repo:** `MyCities-Vue-Quasar`
- **Server clone path:**  
  `/var/www/repos/MyCities-Vue-Quasar`
- **Key files:**
  - `quasar.config.js` – Quasar build configuration
  - `package.json` – scripts like `quasar dev`, `quasar build`, `android`, etc.
  - `src/` – layouts, pages, components (UI logic, but currently **legacy UI**)
  - `dist/spa/` – build output after `npx quasar build`

**Important:**  
When built (`npx quasar build`) and deployed, this repo currently renders the **older “MyCity / Ethekwini Region” UI**, not the new green MyCities UI that’s live.

### 2.2 Laravel backend / admin repo

- **Repo:** `MyCities-Server-Admin---Laravel`
- **Server path (live):**  
  `/var/www/mycities.co.za`
- **Contains:**
  - `app/`, `routes/`, `config/`, `resources/`, `public/`, `vendor/`, etc.
  - `.env` is a symlink:
    - `/var/www/mycities.co.za/.env -> /etc/mycities/.env`
  - `web-app/` – a folder inside the Laravel root that serves the SPA.
    - Path: `/var/www/mycities.co.za/web-app`
    - Contains compiled SPA assets:
      - `index.html`
      - `css/`, `js/`, `img/`, `fonts/`, `icons/`, etc.
    - **This folder currently holds the new green MyCities UI for live.**

There is a `.git` directory inside `/var/www/mycities.co.za`, so this folder is a working copy of the Laravel repo (or a closely related repo).

## 3. Server layout & paths

### 3.1 Live host: `mycities.co.za`

- **DocumentRoot (Apache):**  
  Typically `/var/www/mycities.co.za/public` (standard Laravel).
- **SPA path from browser:**  
  `https://mycities.co.za/web-app/#/`
- **On disk:**
  - Laravel root: `/var/www/mycities.co.za`
  - SPA assets: `/var/www/mycities.co.za/web-app`  
    (This folder is referenced by routes or an Apache alias / rewrite to serve the SPA.)

This **live web-app folder** contains only compiled output (no Quasar `src/`), but it *does* represent the **current, correct green UI**.

### 3.2 Staging host: `staging.mycities.co.za`

- Apache vhost output showed:

  ```text
  DocumentRoot [/var/www/staging.mycities.co.za/public]
